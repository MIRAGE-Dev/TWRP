Libfuse for Android

FUSE[1] is a framework to develop userspace file systems for linux. Since Android is based on linux, it won't be too difficult to port libfuse to Android.

The main problem of building and running libfuse on Android is that the bionic c library lacks support for pthread_cancel(), which is necessary for libfuse multi-thread code. This stackoverflow entry[2] has suggested a solution, which uses SIGUSR1 as an alternative. It seems to work.

Libfuse can be build with Android NDK[3]. If success, you will get libfuse.a and an example program fusexmp. To run the example, the android kernel should be built with FUSE kernel support.
